 * THE FRAGMENT LINK, #track=<version>.<payload>. The whole track travels in the
 * part of an address that a browser never sends to a server, so a link to a
 * whoop track needs no account and no server, and cannot be read by anything
 * between two people who share it in a chat. The payload is the document's
 * compact JSON, deflated where the browser can (`z.`, the raw deflate of the
 * standard CompressionStream) and base64url encoded so it is safe in an address
 * and in a message; where the browser cannot compress it is the JSON itself,
 * encoded the same way (`j.`), longer and just as good. Measured on the shipped
 * whoop presets it is about 1.6 to 2.5 thousand characters, which fits a chat
 * message. It opens as a copy: see start.js.
 *
 * READING ONE IS HOSTILE INPUT, because a link is somebody else's text. The
 * result is null, never a throw, for anything that is not a version and a
 * payload this file made; the inflated size is capped while it streams, so a few
 * kilobytes of address cannot ask for gigabytes of memory; and what comes out is
 * read by the same reader a file is, which never throws and repairs what it can.
 * The ?track= link above keeps working exactly as it did.
