/*
 * autoscale.js: Auto graphics' resolution, chosen from how this machine is
 * actually drawing, and the evidence for moving the preset.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Until 2026-09-27 the preset was a guess from the GPU's
 * name, made once at boot (main.js, beside setGpuInfo): a software rasteriser
 * got Low, a name that looked integrated got Medium, everything else High.
 * Nothing measured whether the guess held, and the pacer written to hold 60
 * by scaling the buffer (pace.js, deleted on 2026-09-28) never reached a map.
 * bug-e82b8bb8 was a laptop on Low that could not be flown
 * for lag. So Auto now watches the frames and moves the one lever that costs
 * nothing to move, the resolution, and says when the preset itself should
 * move, which the shell does only between runs because a preset rebuilds the
 * world.
 *
 * THE LEVER is a factor on the Render scale slider, from FLOOR to 1: the same
 * path the slider takes (renderScaleOf and applyRenderScale in main.js). On
 * the race field it is the canvas's pixel ratio. The town's and a built
 * map's pipelines take it on their own targets (userScale there) and never
 * under their preset's minScale, 0.55, 0.85 and 1.0 of the CSS size on Low,
 * Medium and High. Until 2026-09-28 neither pipeline read the factor at all
 * (review finding F1). On every world, on Medium and High, the shell never
 * lets Auto take the picture under the rubric's 1,200,000 pixels
 * (prompts/bando-perf-loop.md, F4), so Auto cannot pace a 1080p picture into
 * 720p; Low is the one exception, the owner's decision of 2026-09-28
 * (autoMinPixels in quality.js, review finding F6). The floor is set from
 * main.js (autoFloorFor, asking a pipeline's autoFloor where there is one),
 * so Auto counts its time at the floor where the floor really is.
 *
 * THE SIGNALS, per frame, allocation free:
 *   dt       the frame interval: is the page holding sixty
 *   gpuMs    from gpugate.js: how long the GPU takes over a frame, queue
 *            included. The one signal that sees a GPU saturated at vsync,
 *            where dt says 16.7 ms and the frames are late anyway
 *   render   and block: the F5 rule the old pacer had. A frame that is long
 *            because of the page's own script is not helped by fewer
 *            pixels, so a CPU bound frame does not drop the scale
 *
 * THE RULES, with the reasons in the numbers. Every time below is for a
 * 60 Hz target and scales with the target the caller passes, which is the
 * display's own period when that is slower than sixty (see THE TARGET in
 * latency.js): a Steam Deck at 40 Hz is on time at 25 ms, and measured
 * against sixty it used to be paced to the floor with the GPU idle.
 *   over budget  dt average over 18.5 ms (under about 54 fps) and not CPU
 *                bound, or the GPU over 90 percent of a 60 Hz frame. Half
 *                a second of it steps the scale down a tenth.
 *   headroom     dt average under 17.5 ms and the GPU under 55 percent of a
 *                frame. Three seconds of it steps the scale up a twentieth.
 *                Down fast and up slowly, so a pilot sees one change and not
 *                a shimmer. Without GPU timing (no fences) a 60 Hz display
 *                cannot show headroom at all, so it only climbs on a clearly
 *                faster display.
 *   a drop blocks climbing for ten seconds, so a change cannot ping pong.
 *   a change is followed by a cooldown, and the first frames after it are
 *                not believed: resizing the targets hitches, and a hitch
 *                read as load would drop the scale again (the old pacer
 *                had this right, and it is kept).
 *
 * THE PRESET. Three seconds over budget at the floor sets `demote`; forty
 * five seconds at full scale with the GPU under 45 percent sets `promote`.
 * main.js acts on them on the title, between runs: down a step each time the
 * evidence says so, because a machine the name guessed wrong may need two,
 * and up at most once a session and never in a session that came down, so
 * the preset cannot ping pong.
